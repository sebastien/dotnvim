The goal of this (Neo) Vim configuration is to offer a modular, extensible
base that can be shared within an organization and easily customized
without compromising the ability to receive upstream updates.

The configuration is built along the following principles:

- The configuration can be **used as-is by anyone in an organization**,
  and should provide a great experience out of the box.

- Selected plugins are available to offer as-you-type completion,
  fuzzy search, tag/symbol navigation, fast project-wide search and
  code snippets.

- Features can be **enabled/disabled using a simple configuration file**

- Customization by users should not require modifying any file
  part of this distribution, so that upstream changes can be
  seamlessly deployed.
 
- The configuration should be **self-documenting**, so that a usage manual
  with features and specific key bindings are automatically generated
  and easily accessible.

- The configuration should work on Neovim and Vim8+
