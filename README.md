The goal of this (Neo) Vim configuration file is to offer a modular
base for a shareable Vim configuration, where users can edit a simple
configuration file to enable and disable features.

The configuration is built along the following principles:

- The configuration can be **used as-is by anyone in an organization**,
  and should provide a great experience out of the box.

- Features can be **enabled/disabled using a simple configuration file**

- Customization by users should **not require modifying any files
  part of this distribution**, so that upstream changes can be
  seamlessly deployed.
 
- The configuration should be **self-documenting**, so that a usage manual
  with features and specific key bindings are easily accessible.

- The configuration should work on Neovim and Vim8+
